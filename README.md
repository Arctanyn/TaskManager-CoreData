The application was created primarily to familiarize with the CoreData framework and gain knowledge to work with it. 

Task Manager is an application for scheduling tasks of varying degrees of importance. It allows you to add the tasks you plan to the general list. 
You can specify a name, a short description, the degree of importance and the date planned for the completion of the goal. When the task is completed, you can delete it from the list by clicking on the blue circle, swipe the line with the task to the left or click the "delete all" button
